# Web-Project

# Brief

Design a simple web page ui for a smart home. This ui must include functions to:

1. Turn lights on and off
2. View the status of the internet (with functions to restart it)
3. Be able to schedule events such as turning lights off, activating security sensors etc.
4. Take an input of username and password to control the system from outside your home network

Specifications
- All physical requirements obiviously don't have to be done but there needs to be a text output sent to a remote device when it triggers such as another laptop/phone/tablet.
- You can use any API you want but the main scripts should use python scripts eg. login, internet status
- If you need any help let me know via email/phone, this is a pretty hard project but teaches a lot about web ui which is super important to know how to do. In work environments, web pages are the standard for ui so learning how to integrate python scripts and other code elements is pretty useful.
